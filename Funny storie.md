One sunny morning in the little town of Crumpton, Officer Larry had an important mission: to protect the precious donuts at Baker Bob's shop. Baker Bob had noticed that every morning, like clockwork, three donuts mysteriously disappeared from his counter. No crumbs, no trails, nothing.

Larry, a dedicated officer (and donut enthusiast), took the case personally. "No donut thief gets past me!" he declared. He set up a stakeout at the bakery, armed with a thermos of coffee and his sharp detective instincts.

At exactly 5:00 a.m., as the first light of dawn kissed the sleepy town, Larry heard a faint rustling noise. He peeked over the counter and froze. There, standing on two legs, was a raccoon wearing—of all things—a tiny black mask, like some kind of furry burglar. The raccoon had a donut in each paw and was trying to fit a third into its mouth.

"Freeze!" Larry yelled. The raccoon froze, its beady eyes wide with shock. Then, in a blur of fur and sprinkles, it bolted out the back door. Larry chased after it, but the raccoon was quick. It scurried up a tree, clutching its donut prizes.

The next day, Larry came back with a plan. He set up a "decoy donut" filled with jelly that was actually hot sauce. Sure enough, the raccoon returned. It bit into the spicy trap, yelped, and ran away, leaving all the other donuts untouched.

From that day on, the donuts at Baker Bob's remained safe, and Officer Larry became a town hero. As for the raccoon, it was last seen sneaking into the local taco truck.

The end.
